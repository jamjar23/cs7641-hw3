Assignment 3 for Georgia Tech's Machine Learning course , CS 7641, Fall 2018.

Initial clustering analysis performed selectively running script in hw3a.py

Dimensional reduction via PCA, and subsequent clustering analysis, performed using hw3_PCA.py

Dimensional reduction via ICA, and subsequent clustering analysis, performed using hw3_ICA.py

Dimensional reduction via RP/RCA, and subsequent clustering analysis, performed using hw3_RCA.py

silhouette.py and helpers.py contain functions used by the other files; they shoul dbe saved in the same directory as them.

Apologies this is hardly prodution ready code, or even reproducible. Learning and implementing 
these methods has been time consuming (due to time constraints, a fourth DR method has not been 
implemented).  Methods of coding have been refined over the course of the assignment but not 
implemented retroactively, so different pratices have been used to achieve similar objectives;
in particular, after learning hwo to use Pipelines, I would like to have gone back and 
streamlined some more primitive approaches.
